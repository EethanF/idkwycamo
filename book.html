    <h2>Book Reviews</h2>
    <p>Yup book reviews, we all love books, all types of books. However the only books we will be delving into are fantasy books from authors such as George R. R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson and Scott Lynch.</p>
    <div class = "container">
        <div class = "boximg box8"><h3 class = "intro">The Lies of Locke Lamora</h3>
        <p class = eyo>The Lies of Locke Lamora, a book by Scott Lynch, is a story based in a fantasy world about the life of Locke Lamora, an oprhaned child. However the book does not delve into it's fantasy roots until the next book in the series, but we're just keeping the review to this one book.</p>
        <p class = eyo>We go through Locke Lamora's child hood via flash backs through out the book. Locke is part of a group of Elite con artists calling themselves the "Gentleman Bastards" rob the rich of the city of Camorr. In this way it's kind of like a heist book, but the way it's written with twists and turns, the plot really excels compared to many other books I've read.</p>
        <p class = eyo>All in all the book is a great read however as the series progresses the books start going down hill. I think this is due to Lynch trying to expand and build the world rather than just focusing on story and plot, his bread and butter. This first book would make a great stand alone though.</p>

    <div class = "boximg box8"><h3 class = "intro">Around The World In 80 Days</h3>
    <p class = eyo>About a distinguished gentleman who is apart of a club in which he makes a bet that he can travel the globe in 80 days. This is an old victorian novel written in 1873 by Jules Verne, which follows A man on his journey around the world (oobviously). A classic adventure novel suitable for those of all ages. I actually read this on a 5 hour train journey all in one sitting! that's how engrossing and fun it was.</p>
    <p class = eyo>A short to med-sized read Verne bring you accross the world with a character called Phileas Fogg. Though it is not from the aspect of Fogg himself, but his companions and friends he makes a long the way. From deep inside the Indian jungles, over the seas and oceans and all the way Through America, the story is gripping and will always keep you on your toes.</p>
