        <h2 class = intro>Game Reviews</h2>
        <p class = intro>On this page I'm gonna be reviewing games obviously... Games such as League of Legends, World of warcraft and Oldschool Runscape. Yup, A lot of MMO's and of course the infamous LoL.</p>
        </div>
    <div class = "container">
            <div class = "boximg box8"><h3 class = "intro">Oldschool Runescape</h3>
            <p class = eyo>OSRS, one of the gems from my childhood. Oldschool runescape was created and launched 2013 being a remake of runescape from 2007 whilst the main game carried on with some game changing updates. OSRS is an MMORPG which focus on 3 main gameplay aspects; PVM, PVP and skilling.</p>
            <p class = eyo>The feeling of nostalgia I felt when logging back in to this oldschool rendition of Runescape was vast. I used to love playing this game as a kid, getting home and logging on to my windows XP computer to grind out skills and just kill random mobs. It was great, The community is still awesome and there's a lot of new content out now such as , raids, raids 2 and a whole bunch of new bosses!</p>
            </div>
        
        
            <div class = "boximg box5"><h3 class= intro>Hydra, an OSRS Boss</h3>
            <img src = "ims/hydra.png"

        <div class = "boximg box5"><h3 class= intro>The Lichking (a raid boss)</h3>
            <img src = "ims/WoW.jpg"
             width ="400"
             height ="250"/></div>
        
        
        <div class = "boximg box8"><h3 class = "intro">World Of Warcraft</h3>
        <p class = eyo>WoW is another gem from my childhood, playing it as a teenager it is an understatement to say I was addicted to this game. I played this game religously. The variety in content from trianing up skills defeating bosses and quests with a story to tell, you could never really go wrong with WoW. The games graphics are better than OSRS's, but that's really a given with any game.</p>
        <p class = eyo>A huge aspect to this game is that a lot of the content requires you to do it with other people so it is rather inclusive and a lot of fun. Content includes everything from raids which you can run as a 25 man and dungoens of which you can do with 5 people. It's no lie that you can sink a huge amount of hours into this game and a lot of people have, you can tell by the amount of expansions realeased.</p>

        <div class = "container">
            <div class = "boximg box8"><h3 class = "intro">Leage of Legends</h3>
            <p class = eyo>League of legends is a MOBA game, inspired by DOTA which is the "classic" MOBA game. League of Legends has the bigged player base out of any game today with millions logging in everyday. LoL also has a huge E-sports scene which is always fun to watch.</p>
            <p class = eyo>League has always been a constant in my life and I'm definitely not proud of it. The game finds a way to draw you in through its content creators and E-sports.</p>
            <p class = eyo>The game consists of 10 people in a 5v5 environment and the goal is to get past structures to destroy the enemy nexus. League is a very competitive game and this aspect brings a lot of people to the game.</p>
